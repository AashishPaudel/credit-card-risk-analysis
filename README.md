The Project Workflow:
1. Data Cleaning and Transformation in Microsoft SQL Server.(I am using Azure Data Studio with the help of docker in my mac machine to use MS SQL for this project)
      First the data is imported into MS SQL.
      Then the data cleaning is done and the data is transformed using different queries to be made ready for analysis
      Exporting the clean data to Excel
2. Data Exploration and Quality Check in Excel.
      The data quality is verified at first.
      Different pivot table analysis is done to detect any inconsistencies.
      The refined dataset is exported to tableau in CSV format.
3. Data Visualization in Tableau
      Different sheets are created where different visualizations are created.
      All the sheets are put together in a dashboard where different filters and parameters are added to create an interactive dashboard for the end user to see and use.
